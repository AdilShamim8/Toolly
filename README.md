*"The tools you need to build the future, all in one place.*

Welcome to **ToolVault**, crafted with purpose and simplicity to empower every developer’s journey. Here, we don't just provide utilities—we spark creativity, ignite innovation, and remove barriers between your ideas and reality.

## Vision

In the spirit of relentless innovation, ToolVault was born from a belief: that the right tool, at the right time, can change everything. We imagine a world where developers focus on solving problems, not wrestling with setup. ToolVault is that world made real.

* **Seamless Integration**: Designed to plug into your existing workflow; whether you’re scripting, prototyping, or deploying, ToolVault is there.
* **Open by Design**: Every component is open source. Your feedback shapes the next release, and your contributions power the community.

## Core Features

1. **Instant Scaffolding**: Bootstrap any project with a single command.
2. **Smart Formatting**: Keep your code clean and consistent—automatically.
3. **Unified CLI**: One interface to rule them all; no more context switching.
4. **Extensible Plugins**: Build or install plugins that speak your language.
